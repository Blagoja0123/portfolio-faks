              I was born and currently live in Strumica. Ever since I was little I was interested in tinkering with everyday things which
              lead to me being interested in computers and then later on software which influenced a lot of my choices moving forwards, such as 
              having an increased focus on the disciplines that go along with software engineering such as maths and computer science. I've taken part in 
              many competitions including international maths competitions, regional programming competitions and entering a portfolio design contest where I won 3rd place
              with a custom made portfolio in React.
